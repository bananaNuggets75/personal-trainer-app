# Personal Trainer App

This repository contains the initial commit for a personal trainer mobile application being developed using Flutter and Dart. The current implementation includes a simple login page. This project is part of a case study for our final project in one of our college subjects. The original project was developed using SQL and Windows Forms with Visual Studio, but this version is being developed as a mobile app using Android Studio.
