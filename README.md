# Personal Trainer App

This repository contains a functional planner for your workout as part of a personal trainer mobile application being developed using Flutter and Dart. The current implementation includes a login page, a home page with navigation to different sections, and pages for Membership, Workout, and Profile. This project is part of a case study for our final project in one of our college subjects. The original project was developed using SQL and Windows Forms with Visual Studio, but this version is being developed as a mobile app using Android Studio.
